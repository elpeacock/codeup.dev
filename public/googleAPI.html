        <p>The Cooks' House is located in Traverse City, Michigan, the foodie mecca of the Midwest. The chefs focus on fresh food made from sustainable, locally sourced ingredients. Serving only dinner and open Tuesday-Sunday, offerings are appetizers and five or seven course tasting menus that constantly change with the availability of ingredients. I make it a point to eat here every time I am in Traverse City visiting family. While I have never had the same meal twice, every meal has been memorable and delicious! In addition to offering up amazing locally sourced food, the Cooks' House also offers cooking classes using the same high quality ingredients. They also do guest chef meal events on a regular basis that feature an up and coming new chef from the local Great Lakes Culinary Institute. If you're lucky enough to get a reservation, don't pass up the opportunity!</p>
